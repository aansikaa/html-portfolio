<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hello! I'm Aansika!
  <br/>
  As a student and JEE aspirant at Bakliwal, I've always been drawn to a blend of creative and technical 
  pursuits. From coding to playing the ukulele, my interests reflect my passion for both structure and artistry.
   At the top of my class in JEE preparation, I'm deeply committed to pushing boundaries in my studies and in 
   every project I undertake. I've also delved into data and fashion analytics, merging my love for numbers 
   with a keen eye for trends and patterns, helping me bring unique insights to everything I work on. </p>

<p>Outside academics, I'm active in event managementâ€”a venture that allows me to connect, organize, and 
  bring people together. Creating seamless, memorable experiences is incredibly rewarding and fuels my 
  entrepreneurial spirit. This passion aligns closely with my ultimate goal: establishing a reputable, 
  well-organized event management firm that excels in both planning and execution. Bringing analytical 
  insights into event management is my unique approach, ensuring each event is as engaging 
  as it is efficient.</p>

<p>Looking forward, I'm equally focused on building a robust career in singing and technology. With my coding 
  skills and a keen interest in programming, I'm working toward launching a dynamic platform for coding 
  resources and tutorials. Alongside, I aspire to grow as a performer, sharing my love for music and the
   ukulele with a wider audience. Whether through my voice, my skills in organizing events, or my work in 
   tech, I'm passionate about leaving a meaningful mark in each area I pursue.
